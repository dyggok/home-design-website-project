:heavy_check_mark: The wardropes taken from json file are displayed on the main page. You can find the json file in the project. <br />
:heavy_check_mark: There is a pagination structure on the main page. You can see the wardropes on the other page with the help of the buttons below. <br />
:heavy_check_mark: When you click the 'Sepete Ekle' button, a modal will open where the information will be retrieved. <br /> 
:heavy_check_mark: There are mandatory fields in the modal. If mandatory fields are not filled, the fields are painted red and the product is not added to the cart. <br />
:heavy_check_mark: When the mandatory fields are filled and you click the 'G√∂nder' button, the product is painted green. This indicates that it has been added to the cart. <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Lazy loading structure is also available in the project. <br />

ps: There is no backend structure, so the information that it has been added to the cart is kept in localstorage.
